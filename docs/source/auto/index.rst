SLAYER Auto modules
==========================================
SLAYER Auto modules are helper modules. They include dataset wrapper, trainig/testing assistant and 
Loihi network automation and export modules. They are inteneded to reduce redundant and repeating 
structures in SLAYER training, therefore, the user should be able to focus more on the network design.

See the individual modules for what auto functionality they add.
